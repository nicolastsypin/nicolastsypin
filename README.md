## Hello! üòÅ

My name is Nicolas Tsypin and I am a third-year student at the **University of Notre Dame.** ‚òòÔ∏è Originally from Florida, I am now studying **Economics** with minors in **Data Science** and **Constitutional Studies.** With this blend of knowledge, I want to use quantitative skills and analysis to help others and solve big social problems. I am a lifelong learner and love playing soccer, solving crosswords, and beating my roommates in video games.

### Technical Proficiency

I have taken multiple coding courses at both the high school and undergraduate levels and am familiar with the basics of coding fundamentals and syntax, especially in Python. Through my economics coursework, I have also used Stata a lot and know how to use it for data exploration and analysis. 

| Human Languages | Programming Languages |
-------------------|-------------------------
|English (native)|Java (Beginner)|
|Russian (native)|SAS (Beginner)|
| |Python (Intermediate)|
| |HTML/CSS (Beginner)|
| |STATA (Intermediate)|
| |R (just started learning!)|

### Current Projects and Goals

I am learning R through independent lab work in my Sport + Big Data class. I am also gaining further familiarity with Python in my Intro to Data Science Class. After this semester, I hope to be able to better integrate my technical skills into broader economic and data analysis.
