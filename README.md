## Hello! 😁

My name is Nicolas Tsypin, and I am a senior at the **University of Notre Dame.** ☘️ Originally from Florida, I am now studying **Economics** with minors in **Data Science** and **Constitutional Studies.** With this blend of knowledge, I want to use quantitative skills and analysis to help others and solve big social problems. I am a lifelong learner and love playing soccer, solving crosswords, and beating my roommates in video games.

### Technical Proficiency

I have taken multiple coding courses at both the high school and undergraduate levels and am familiar with the basics of coding fundamentals and syntax, especially in Python. Through my economics coursework, I have also used Stata a lot and know how to use it for data exploration and analysis.

### Current Projects and Goals

In the Spring of 2025, I developed my Python and R skills through my courses Intro to Data Science and Sport + Big Data. I have worked on data analysis and machine learning as well as creating regression models and graphs. I am also a research assistant in the economics department and use Stata to analyze data and run regressions.
