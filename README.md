## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicolas Tsypin and I am a third-year student at the **University of Notre Dame.** Originally from Florida, I am now studying **Economics** with minors in **Data Science** and **Constitutional Studies.** With this blend of knowledge, I want to use quantitative skills and analysis to help others and solve big social problems.
